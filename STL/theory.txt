// Introduction to the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++

// The Standard Template Library (STL) is a powerful library in C++ that provides a collection of generic algorithms and data structures. It is a part of the C++ Standard Library and is widely used for its efficiency and ease of use.

// Features of the STL:
// 1. Containers: The STL provides various container classes such as vectors, lists, sets, maps, etc. These containers are implemented as templates and offer different functionalities like dynamic resizing, efficient insertion/deletion, and random access.

// 2. Algorithms: The STL includes a wide range of algorithms that operate on the containers. These algorithms are generic and can be used with different container types. Some common algorithms include sorting, searching, merging, and transforming elements.

// 3. Iterators: Iterators are used to traverse the elements of a container. The STL provides different types of iterators, such as input iterators, output iterators, forward iterators, bidirectional iterators, and random access iterators. Iterators allow us to perform operations on container elements without exposing the underlying implementation.

// 4. Function Objects: Function objects, also known as functors, are objects that can be called as if they were functions. The STL utilizes function objects to provide flexible and customizable behavior for algorithms. Function objects can be used for sorting, searching, and other operations.

// 5. Memory Management: The STL includes memory management utilities like allocators, which allow customization of memory allocation and deallocation strategies. This enables efficient memory usage and control.

// 6. Exception Safety: The STL provides strong exception safety guarantees, ensuring that operations on containers and algorithms are exception-safe. This helps in writing robust and reliable code.

// Overall, the STL in C++ provides a rich set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to write efficient and reusable code. It promotes code reusability, modularity, and maintainability.

// Different Data Structures and Their Main Important Functions in STL:

// 1. Vector:
// - Functions: push_back, pop_back, size, empty, clear, insert, erase, resize, reserve, at, front, back

// 2. List:
// - Functions: push_back, push_front, pop_back, pop_front, size, empty, clear, insert, erase, resize, sort, reverse, unique

// 3. Set:
// - Functions: insert, erase, size, empty, clear, find, count, lower_bound, upper_bound

// 4. Map:
// - Functions: insert, erase, size, empty, clear, find, count, lower_bound, upper_bound

// 5. Stack:
// - Functions: push, pop, top, size, empty

// 6. Queue:
// - Functions: push, pop, front, back, size, empty

// 7. Priority Queue:
// - Functions: push, pop, top, size, empty

// These are just a few examples of the data structures available in the STL. Each data structure has its own set of functions that provide different operations and functionalities. The STL provides a consistent interface for working with these data structures, making it easier to write generic code that can work with different container types.
